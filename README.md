Here’s a concise and clear GitVehicle Rentals is a DBMS project that connects users with vehicle owners for easy rentals. Built with PHP, MySQL, and XAMPP, it features vendor/user dashboards, vehicle listings, bookings, and WhatsApp integration for real-time communication.

In today’s fast-paced world, people often look for convenient, affordable, and flexible transportation options without the burden of vehicle ownership. Simultaneously, many vehicle owners, especially small businesses and individuals, seek opportunities to earn passive income by renting out their vehicles. This gap between vehicle owners and renters inspired us to build a solution.
We imagined a system where vendors can register their unused or spare vehicles and earn revenue by listing them for rent. On the other side, users can easily browse available vehicles, compare prices, and book them for personal or professional use—all with just a few clicks.
This idea formed the foundation of our DBMS project — “Vehicle Rentals”, a web-based platform that bridges the gap between those who want to rent out their vehicles and those who need to rent a vehicle.
We started with a simple goal: connect vendors and users on a single platform, powered by a structured and optimized MySQL database. Using PHP and XAMPP, we built dynamic dashboards that serve the unique needs of vendors and users, offering features like car listings, bookings, rental updates, and direct communication through WhatsApp.
Our platform simulates a real-world rental system and showcases how a well-designed database-driven website can provide efficient, scalable, and user-friendly services. This project not only helped us understand the practical implementation of DBMS concepts but also sparked ideas for real-world entrepreneurship in the transportation sector.
